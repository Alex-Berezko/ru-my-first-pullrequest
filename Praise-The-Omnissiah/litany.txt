I convert this instrument of art,
To breathe in electronic breathe
To convulse in sonic wave
That which thou desirest is accomplished,
be thy will performed,
and all mine demands fulfilled.
grant that unto succour, favour and unison,
by the invocation of the Holy Name, so that these things may serve us for aid in all that we wish to perform therewith
