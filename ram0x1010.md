What does GIT mean? 

From the first README:

> GIT - the stupid content tracker
>
> "git" can mean anything, depending on your mood.
>
> - random three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not actually used by any common UNIX command.  The fact that it is a mispronunciation of "get" may or may not be relevant.
> - stupid. contemptible and despicable. simple. Take your pick from the dictionary of slang.
> - "global information tracker": you're in a good mood, and it actually works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room. 
> - "goddamn idiotic truckload of sh*t": when it breaks
>
> This is a stupid (but extremely fast) directory content manager. It doesn't do a whole lot, but what it _does_ do is track directory contents efficiently."
